680	Valid Palindrome II

Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character.  Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: "aba"
Output: True


Example 2:
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

The maximum length of the string is 50000.

==================================================

679	24 Game

You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9.  You need to judge whether they could operated through *, /, +, -, (, ) to get the value of 24.

Example 1:
Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24


Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: False


Note:

The division operator / represents real division, not integer division.  For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
Every operation done is between two numbers.  In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operator.  For example, with [1, 1, 1, 1] as input, the expression -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 is not allowed.
You cannot concatenate numbers together.  For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2], we cannot write this as 12 + 12.


==================================================

678	Valid Parenthesis String

Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
An empty string is also valid.


Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: True


Example 2:
Input: "(*)"
Output: True


Example 3:
Input: "(*))"
Output: True


Note:

The string size will be in the range [1, 100].

677	Map Sum Pairs

Implement a MapSum class with insert, and sum methods.


For the method insert, you'll be given a pair of (string, integer). The string represents the key and the integer represents the value. If the key already existed, then the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.


For the method sum, you'll be given a string representing the prefix, and you need to return the sum of all the pairs' value whose key starts with the prefix.

Example 1:
Input: insert("apple", 3), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 3
Input: insert("app", 2), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 5

==================================================

676	Implement Magic Dictionary

Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.


For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.


For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify exactly one character into another character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False


Note:

You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.

655	Print Binary Tree
Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules: 

The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
The column number n should always be an odd number.
The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them. 
Each unused space should contain an empty string "".
Print the subtrees following the same rules.

Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party respectively. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.


The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.


Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party, you need to predict which party will finally announce the victory and make the change in the Dota2 game. The output should be Radiant or Dire.

Example 1:
Input: "RD"
Output: "Radiant"
Explanation: The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1. And the second senator can't exercise any rights any more since his right has been banned. And in the round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.


Example 2:
Input: "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1. And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in the round 1. And in the round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.


Note:

The length of the given string will in the range [1, 10,000].

648	Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.


Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.


You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:
Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"


Note:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
 1 <= dict words number <= 1000 
 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000  
 1 <= root length <= 100 
 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

646	Maximum Length of Pair Chain

You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.


Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. 


Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]

Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]


Note:

The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].

==================================================

645	Set Mismatch

The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number. 


Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]

639	Decode Ways II

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping way:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26


Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which can be treated as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.


Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number of ways to decode it.


Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: "*"
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can be decoded to the string: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".


Example 2:
Input: "1*"
Output: 9 + 9 = 18


Note:

The length of the input string will fit in range [1, 105].
The input string will only contain the character '*' and digits '0' - '9'.

638	Shopping Offers

In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.


However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.


You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item.
The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.


Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.
Example 1:
Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: 
There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.


Example 2:
Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.


Note:

There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.

637	Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].


Note:

The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

==================================================

636	Exclusive Time of Functions
Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive single threaded CPU, find the exclusive time of these functions. 
Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. A function may be called recursively or by another function.
A log is a string has this format : function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. For example, "0:start:0" means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time 0. "0:end:0" means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0. 
Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this function, the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered as this function's exclusive time. You should return the exclusive time of each function sorted by their function id.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 2
logs = 
["0:start:0",
 "1:start:2",
 "1:end:5",
 "0:end:6"]
Output:[3, 4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1. 
Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2, executes 4 units of time and end at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at time 6, and also end at the time 6, thus executes 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally execute 4 units of time.


Note:

Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id.
Your output should be sorted by function id, which means the 0th element of your output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0.
Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
Functions could be called recursively, and will always end.
1 <= n <= 100

632	Smallest Range
You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists. 
We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.
Example 1:
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].



Note:

The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
1 <= k <= 3500
 -105 <= value of elements <= 105.
For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List<List<Integer>>. And after you reset the code template, you'll see this point.

630	Course Schedule III

There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. Each course has some duration(course length)  t and closed on dth day. A course should be taken continuously for t days and must be finished before or on the dth day. You will start at the 1st day.


Given n online courses represented by pairs (t,d), your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.

Example:
Input: [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.


Note:

The integer 1 <= d, t, n <= 10,000. 
You can't take two courses simultaneously.

629	K Inverse Pairs Array

Given two integers n and k, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs. 


We define an inverse pair as following:
For ith and jth element in the array, if i < j and a[i] > a[j] then it's an inverse pair; Otherwise, it's not.


Since the answer may be very large, the answer should be modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pair.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.

623	Add One Row to Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1. 
The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.
Example 1:
Input: 
A binary tree as following:
       4

621	Task Scheduler
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.
However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle. 
You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.
Example 1:
Input: tasks = ['A','A','A','B','B','B'], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

617	Merge Two Binary Trees

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. 


You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

Example 1:
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \

609	Find Duplicate File in System
Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, you need to find out all the groups of duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths.
A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have exactly the same content.
A single directory info string in the input list has the following format: 
"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"
It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt with content f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content, respectively) in directory root/d1/d2/.../dm. Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.
The output is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format: 
"directory_path/file_name.txt"
Example 1:
Input:
["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output:  
[["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]


Note:

No order is required for the final output.
You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and digits, and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].
The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].
You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path and file info are separated by a single blank space.


Follow-up beyond contest:

 Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
 If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
 If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
 What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
 How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
==================================================

606	Construct String from Binary Tree
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.
The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
Example 1:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".


Example 2:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

==================================================

605	Can Place Flowers
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.
Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True


Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False


Note:

The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

600	Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones
Given a positive integer n, find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule. 


Note:
1 <= n <= 109

==================================================

599	Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings. 


You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".


Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).


Note:

The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
No duplicates in both lists.

==================================================

598	Range Addition II
Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.
Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b. 
You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
Example 1:
Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.


Note:

The range of m and n is [1,40000].
The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

==================================================

594	Longest Harmonious Subsequence
We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
Example 1:
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].


Note:
The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.

==================================================

593	Valid Square
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.
The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.
Example:
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: True


 Note: 

All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
Input points have no order.

==================================================

592	Fraction Addition and Subtraction
Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, say 2, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.
Example 1:
Input:"-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"


Example 2:
Input:"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"


Example 3:
Input:"1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"


Example 4:
Input:"5/3+1/3"
Output: "2/1"


Note:

The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the output.
Each fraction (input and output) has format Â±numerator/denominator. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].
The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

==================================================

591	Tag Validator
Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. 
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. 

Valid Code Examples:
Input: "<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input: "<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> "<DIV>"
end_tag -> "</DIV>"
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> ">>  ![cdata[]] "
cdata -> "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>", where the CDATA_CONTENT is "<div>]>"
text2 -> "]]>>]"

The reason why start_tag is NOT "<DIV>>>" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>" is because of the rule 7.


Invalid Code Examples:
Input: "<A>  <B> </A>   </B>"
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If "<A>" is closed, then "<B>" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: "<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>"
Output: False


Note:

For simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain letters, digits, '<','>','/','!','[',']' and ' '.

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
Output: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
Explanation:

Even you only have trees in a line, you need to use rope to enclose them. 


 Note: 

All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose trees that will separate them in more than one group.

You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.
Example 1:
Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
Output: 5
Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.


Note:

Then length of the input array is in range [1, 10,000].
The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means <=.

576	Out of Boundary Paths
There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
N is in range [0,50].

==================================================

575	Distribute Candies
Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain. 

Example 1:
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 


Example 2:
Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. 


Note:

The length of the given array is in range [2, 10,000], and will be even.

Input:s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output:True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").


Example 2:
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"

566	Reshape the Matrix
In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.


You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.
The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.


If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.


Example 2:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.


Note:

The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
The given r and c are all positive.

563	Binary Tree Tilt
Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.
The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.
The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.
Example:
Input: 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

554	Brick Wall
There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. 

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right. 

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks. 
You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. 
Example:
Input: 
[[1,2,2,1],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,2],
 [2,4],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 



Note:

The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000. 

==================================================

553	Optimal Division
Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.
However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.
Example:
Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/((100/10)/2)" are redundant, since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)". 

Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2


Note:

The length of the input array is [1, 10].
Elements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].
There is only one optimal division for each test case.

552	Student Attendance Record II
Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:


'A' : Absent. 
'L' : Late.
 'P' : Present. 



A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 8 
Explanation:
There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
"PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times. 


Note:
The value of n won't exceed 100,000.

==================================================

551	Student Attendance Record I
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:



'A' : Absent. 
'L' : Late.
 'P' : Present. 



A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).    
You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

547	Friend Circles

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.


Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.


Example 2:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],

529	Minesweeper
Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)! 
You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. 'M' represents an unrevealed mine, 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square, 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and finally 'X' represents a revealed mine.
Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:


If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to 'X'.
If an empty square ('E') with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
If an empty square ('E') with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

Example 1:
Input: 

[['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]

 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Click : [1,2]

Output: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:




Note:

The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].
The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.
The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been revealed).
For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you don't need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.

Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to the multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.

Example 1:
Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.


Example 2:
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google".

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

Example 1:
Input: "USA"
Output: True

514	Freedom Trail

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door. 


Given a string ring, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.


At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:

You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.

508	Most Frequent Subtree Sum

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Examples 1
Input:
  5
 /  \
2   -3

return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.

Examples 2
Input:
  5
 /  \
2   -5

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.

Note:
You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

503	Next Greater Element II

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; ==================================================

502	IPO

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. 


You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.


To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.

Example 1:
Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].

Output: 4

Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.


Note:

You may assume all numbers in the input are non-negative integers.
The length of Profits array and Capital array will not exceed 50,000.
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

501	Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2



return [2].

Note:
If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up:
Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
==================================================

500	Keyboard Row
Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of alphabet on only one row's of American keyboard like the image below.

498	Diagonal Traverse

Given a matrix of M x N elements (M rows, N columns), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image. 

Example:
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]
Explanation:



Note:

The total number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

==================================================

496	Next Greater Element I

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2. 


The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.


Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.


Note:

All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

==================================================

495	Teemo Attacking

In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.
Example 1:
Input: [1,4], 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. So you finally need to output 4.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2], 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. So you finally need to output 3.


Note:

You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.

==================================================

494	Target Sum

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.  

Example 1:
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.


Note:

The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20. 
The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

492	Construct the Rectangle

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.


Note:

The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

==================================================

491	Increasing Subsequences

486	Predict the Winner
Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins. 
Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score. 
Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.


Example 2:
Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.


Note:

1 <= length of the array <= 20. 
Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.


Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

483	Smallest Good Base
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.
Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format. 
Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.


Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.


Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.


Note:

The range of n is [3, 10^18].
The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.

==================================================

482	License Key Formatting
Now you are given a string S, which represents a software license key which we would like to format. The string S is composed of alphanumerical characters and dashes. The dashes split the alphanumerical characters within the string into groups. (i.e. if there are M dashes, the string is split into M+1 groups). The dashes in the given string are possibly misplaced.
We want each group of characters to be of length K (except for possibly the first group, which could be shorter, but still must contain at least one character). To satisfy this requirement, we will reinsert dashes. Additionally, all the lower case letters in the string must be converted to upper case.
So, you are given a non-empty string S, representing a license key to format, and an integer K. And you need to return the license key formatted according to the description above.
Example 1:
Input: S = "2-4A0r7-4k", K = 4

Output: "24A0-R74K"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.


Example 2:
Input: S = "2-4A0r7-4k", K = 3

Output: "24-A0R-74K"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 3 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as said above.


Note:

The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
String S is non-empty.

==================================================

481	Magical String

A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:


The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.


The first few elements of string S is the following:
S = "1221121221221121122â€¦â€¦"


If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:


1   22  11  2  1  22  1  22  11  2  11  22 ......


and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:


1   2	   2    1   1    2     1    2     2    1    2    2 ......


You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself. 


Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

Note:
N will not exceed 100,000.

Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

==================================================

480	Sliding Window Median
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
Examples: 
[2,3,4] , the median is 3
[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Your job is to output the median array for each window in the original array.
For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.
Window position                Median
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       1
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       3
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       5
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      6

Therefore, return the median sliding window as [1,-1,-1,3,5,6].
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, ie: k is always smaller than input array's size for non-empty array.==================================================

479	Largest Palindrome Product
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.
 Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.
Example:
Input: 2
Output: 987
Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987


Note:
The range of n is [1,8].

476	Number Complement
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.


Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

==================================================

475	Heaters
Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.
So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
Note:

Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.


Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3],[2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.

468	Validate IP Address

Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.


IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,172.16.254.1;


Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.


IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).


However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.


Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.

Note:
You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.

Example 1:
Input: "172.16.254.1"

Output: "IPv4"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".


Example 2:
Input: "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"

Output: "IPv6"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".


Example 3:
Input: "256.256.256.256"

Output: "Neither"

Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.

467	Unique Substrings in Wraparound String
Consider the string s to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so s will look like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".
Now we have another string p. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of p are present in s. In particular, your input is the string p and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of p in the string s.
Note: p consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of p might be over 10000.
Example 1:
Input: "a"
Output: 1

Explanation: Only the substring "a" of string "a" is in the string s.


Example 2:
Input: "cac"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two substrings "a", "c" of string "cac" in the string s.


Example 3:
Input: "zab"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six substrings "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", "zab" of string "zab" in the string s.

==================================================

466	Count The Repetitions
Define S = [s,n] as the string S which consists of n connected strings s. For example, ["abc", 3] ="abcabcabc". 
On the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, â€œabcâ€�  can be obtained from â€œabdbecâ€� based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from â€œacbbeâ€�.
You are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 ≤ n1 ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ n2 ≤ 106. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where S1=[s1,n1] and S2=[s2,n2]. Find the maximum integer M such that [S2,M] can be obtained from S1.
Example:
Input:
s1="acb", n1=4
s2="ab", n2=2

Return:
2

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins. 
What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers? 
For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally. 
You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.

Example
Input:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:
false

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

463	Island Perimeter
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
Example:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Answer: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

462	Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.
You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.
Example:
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

==================================================

461	Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

==================================================

460	LFU Cache
Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.


get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
Example:
LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3.
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4

459	Repeated Substring Pattern
Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.  You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length  will not exceed 10000. 

Example 1:
Input: "abab"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.


Example 2:
Input: "aba"

Output: False


Example 3:
Input: "abcabcabcabc"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)

==================================================

456	132 Pattern

Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such
that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.
Note: n will be less than 15,000.
Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.


Example 2:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].


Example 3:
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

==================================================

455	Assign Cookies

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

==================================================

454	4Sum II
Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.
To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.
Example:
Input:
A = [ 1, 2]
B = [-2,-1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [ 0, 2]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0

==================================================

453	Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements
Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.
Example:
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

==================================================

452	Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons. 
Example:
Input:
[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

==================================================

451	Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
Example 1:
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.


Example 2:
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.


Example 3:
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

==================================================

450	Delete Node in a BST
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.


Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).
Example:
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7

==================================================

449	Serialize and Deserialize BST
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. 
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.


Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
==================================================

448	Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]

447	Number of Boomerangs
Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
Example:
Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]

==================================================

446	Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A subsequence slice of that array is any sequence of integers (P0, P1, ..., Pk) such that 0 ≤ P0 < P1 < ... < Pk < N.
A subsequence slice (P0, P1, ..., Pk) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence A[P0], A[P1], ..., A[Pk-1], A[Pk] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that k ≥ 2.
The function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array A. 
The input contains N integers. Every integer is in the range of -231 and 231-1 and 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000. The output is guaranteed to be less than 231-1.

Example:
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Output: 7

Explanation:
All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]

445	Add Two Numbers II
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
Follow up:
What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.


Example:
Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7

441	Arranging Coins
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
Example 1:
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
Â¤
Â¤ Â¤
Â¤ Â¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


Example 2:
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
Â¤
Â¤ Â¤
Â¤ Â¤ Â¤
Â¤ Â¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

440	K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order
Given integers n and k, find the lexicographically k-th smallest integer in the range from 1 to n.
Note: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 109.
Example:
Input:
n: 13   k: 2

Output:
10

Explanation:
The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.

438	Find All Anagrams in a String
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
The order of output does not matter.
Example 1:
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".


Example 2:
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

==================================================

437	Path Sum III
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
(traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11


==================================================

436	Find Right Interval

Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.


For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.


Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2] ]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.


Example 2:
Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

Output: [-1, 0, 1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.


Example 3:
Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

Output: [-1, 2, -1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.

==================================================

435	Non-overlapping Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.


Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.


Example 2:
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.


Example 3:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

Implement a data structure supporting the following operations:


Inc(Key) - Inserts a new key  with value 1. Or increments an existing key by 1. Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
Dec(Key) - If Key's value is 1, remove it from the data structure. Otherwise decrements an existing key by 1. If the key does not exist, this function does nothing. Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
GetMaxKey() - Returns one of the keys with maximal value. If no element exists, return an empty string "".
GetMinKey() - Returns one of the keys with minimal value. If no element exists, return an empty string "".

424	Longest Repeating Character Replacement
Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
Note:
Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.


Example 1:
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.



Example 2:
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

Given a non-empty string containing an out-of-order English representation of digits 0-9, output the digits in ascending order.
Note:

Input contains only lowercase English letters.
Input is guaranteed to be valid and can be transformed to its original digits. That means invalid inputs such as "abc" or "zerone" are not permitted.
Input length is less than 50,000.


Example 1:
Input: "owoztneoer"

Output: "012"

 It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit. 
 It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met). 

Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.
Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change.==================================================

419	Battleships in a Board
Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:


You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

Example:
X..X
...X
...X

In the above board there are 2 battleships.

417	Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.
Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.
Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.
Note:

The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
Both m and n are less than 150.


Example:
Given the following 5x5 matrix:

  Pacific ~   ~   ~   ~   ~ 
       ~  1   2   2   3  (5) *
       ~  3   2   3  (4) (4) *
       ~  2   4  (5)  3   1  *
       ~ (6) (7)  1   4   5  *
       ~ (5)  1   1   2   4  *
          *   *   *   *   * Atlantic

Return:

[[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [3, 0], [3, 1], [4, 0]] (positions with parentheses in above matrix).

416	Partition Equal Subset Sum
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:

Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
The array size will not exceed 200.


Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].


Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

==================================================

415	Add Strings
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

==================================================

414	Third Maximum Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).
Example 1:
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.


Example 2:
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.


Example 3:
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.

==================================================

413	Arithmetic Slices
A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.
A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
    A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.
The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A. 

Example:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.

But for multiples of three it should output â€œFizzâ€� instead of the number and for the multiples of five output â€œBuzzâ€�. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output â€œFizzBuzzâ€�.
Example:
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",

410	Split Array Largest Sum
Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Note:
If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
1 ≤ m ≤ min(50, n)


Examples: 
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

409	Longest Palindrome
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
Note:
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

Example: 
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

407	Trapping Rain Water II
Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

Note:
Both m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.

Example:
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.




The above image represents the elevation map [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.



After the rain, water are trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.
==================================================

406	Queue Reconstruction by Height
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

==================================================

405	Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.


Example 1:
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"


Example 2:
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"

404	Sum of Left Leaves
Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.
Example:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.

==================================================

403	Frog Jump
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
Note:

The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.
Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
The first stone's position is always 0.


Example 1:
[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.


Example 2:
[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

==================================================

402	Remove K Digits
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:

The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.

==================================================

401	Binary Watch
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
Example:
Input: n = 1Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]

Note:

The order of output does not matter.
The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

==================================================

400	Nth Digit
Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... 
Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:
Input:
3

Output:
3


Example 2:
Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

==================================================

399	Evaluate Division

Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where  A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

Example:
Given  a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0. queries are:  a / c = ?,  b / a = ?, a / e = ?,  a / a = ?, x / x = ? . return  [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].


The input is:  vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries , where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return  vector<double>.

According to the example above:
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 


The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
==================================================

398	Random Pick Index

Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.


Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);

==================================================

397	Integer Replacement

Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:



If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.



What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

==================================================

396	Rotate Function

Given an array of integers A and let n to be its length.


Assume Bk to be an array obtained by rotating the array A k positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function" F on A as follow:


F(k) = 0 * Bk[0] + 1 * Bk[1] + ... + (n-1) * Bk[n-1].
Calculate the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1). 

Note:
n is guaranteed to be less than 105.

Example:
A = [4, 3, 2, 6]

F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.

==================================================

395	Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

Example 1:
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.


Example 2:
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

==================================================

394	Decode String

Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.
Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

Examples:
s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

==================================================

393	UTF-8 Validation
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.


Note:
The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.


Example 1:
data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

Return true.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.



Example 2:
data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

Return false.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

==================================================

392	Is Subsequence

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.


You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).


A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"


Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"


Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

391	Perfect Rectangle

Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.


Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).


Example 1:
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,4]
]

Return true. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.




Example 2:
rectangles = [
  [1,1,2,3],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.




Example 3:
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap in the top center.




Example 4:
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.


==================================================

390	Elimination Game

There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.
Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
Example:
Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

==================================================

389	Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.
Example:
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

==================================================

388	Longest Absolute File Path
Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:
The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext

The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.
The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext

The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.
We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).
Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note:

The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..


Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.
Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.==================================================

387	First Unique Character in a String

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.



Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.
==================================================

386	Lexicographical Numbers

Given an integer n, return 1 - n in lexicographical order.


For example, given 13, return: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].


Please optimize your algorithm to use less time and space. The input size may be as large as 5,000,000.
==================================================

385	Mini Parser
Given a nested list of integers represented as a string, implement a parser to deserialize it.
Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
Note:
You may assume that the string is well-formed:

String is non-empty.
String does not contain white spaces.
String contains only digits 0-9, [, - ,, ].


Example 1:
Given s = "324",

You should return a NestedInteger object which contains a single integer 324.


Example 2:
Given s = "[123,[456,[789]]]",

Return a NestedInteger object containing a nested list with 2 elements:

1. An integer containing value 123.
2. A nested list containing two elements:
    i.  An integer containing value 456.
    ii. A nested list with one element:
         a. An integer containing value 789.

==================================================

384	Shuffle an Array
Shuffle a set of numbers without duplicates.

Example:
// Init an array with set 1, 2, and 3.
int[] nums = {1,2,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result. Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned.
solution.shuffle();

// Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3].
solution.reset();

// Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3].
solution.shuffle();

==================================================

383	Ransom Note

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom 
note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false. 


Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true

==================================================

382	Linked List Random Node
Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.
Follow up:
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

Example:
// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();

381	Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.
Note: Duplicate elements are allowed.


insert(val): Inserts an item val to the collection.
remove(val): Removes an item val from the collection if present.
getRandom: Returns a random element from current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same value the collection contains.


Example:
// Init an empty collection.
RandomizedCollection collection = new RandomizedCollection();

// Inserts 1 to the collection. Returns true as the collection did not contain 1.
collection.insert(1);

// Inserts another 1 to the collection. Returns false as the collection contained 1. Collection now contains [1,1].
collection.insert(1);

// Inserts 2 to the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
collection.insert(2);

// getRandom should return 1 with the probability 2/3, and returns 2 with the probability 1/3.
collection.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,2].
collection.remove(1);

// getRandom should return 1 and 2 both equally likely.
collection.getRandom();

==================================================

380	Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.


insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present.
getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.


Example:
// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.

378	Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example:
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,

377	Combination Sum IV
 Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
Example:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7==================================================

376	Wiggle Subsequence
A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence. 
For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

375	Guess Number Higher or Lower II
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower. 
However, when you guess a particular number x,  and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.


Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.



Example 1:
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
    Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].


Example 2:
tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
    Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
    Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.

331	Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.
     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.
Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.
You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".
Example 1:
"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Return true
Example 2:
"1,#"
Return false
Example 3:
"9,#,#,1"
Return false

330	Patching Array
Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

Example 1:
nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Return 1.
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
Example 2:
nums = [1, 5, 10], n = 20
Return 2.
The two patches can be [2, 4].
Example 3:
nums = [1, 2, 2], n = 5
Return 0.

329	Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:
nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]



Return 4

The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

Example 2:
nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]



Return 4

The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

328	Odd Even Linked List
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

Example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.


Note:
The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input. 
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

327	Count of Range Sum

    Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

    Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and 
    j (i ≤ j), inclusive.


Note:
    A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.


Example:
    Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
    Return 3.
    The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

Example:
    (1) Given nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4], one possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.


Example 1:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)


Example 2:
coins = [2], amount = 3

321	Create Maximum Number

    Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers.
    Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits
    from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the k digits. You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.


Example 1:


    nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
    nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
    k = 5
    return [9, 8, 6, 5, 3]


Example 2:


    nums1 = [6, 7]
    nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
    k = 5
    return [6, 7, 6, 0, 4]


Example 3:


    nums1 = [3, 9]

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.


Example:
Given n = 3. 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
==================================================

318	Maximum Product of Word Lengths

    Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters.
    You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters.
    If no such two words exist, return 0.


Example 1:


    Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
    Return 16
    The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".


Example 2:


    Given ["a", "ab", "abc", "d", "cd", "bcd", "abcd"]
    Return 4
    The two words can be "ab", "cd".


Example 3:


    Given ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]
    Return 0
    No such pair of words.

You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array.
The counts array has the property where counts[i] is 
the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:
Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]

To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

313	Super Ugly Number

    Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.


    Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list
    primes of size k. For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32]
 is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes
    = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.


Note:
    (1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
    (2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
    (3) 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
    (4) The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

312	Burst Balloons

    Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
    number on it represented by array nums.

    You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst
    balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left
    and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right
    then becomes adjacent.


    Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.


Note: 
    (1) You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
    (2) 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100


Example:


    Given [3, 1, 5, 8]


    Return 167

    nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
   coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167

310	Minimum Height Trees

    For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
    Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.


Format
    The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1.
    You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

 
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are
    undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in
    edges.


Example 1:


    Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3


    return  [1]


Example 2:


    Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5


    return  [3, 4]


Note:


    (1) According to the definition
    of tree on Wikipedia: â€œa tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
    exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.â€�


    (2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a
    leaf.

309	Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
(ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

Example:
prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
maxProfit = 3
transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

307	Range Sum Query - Mutable
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

Example:
Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8


Note:

The array is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.

==================================================

306	Additive Number
Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.
A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

For example:
"112358" is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
"199100199" is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199


Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

Example:
Given matrix = [

The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

299	Bulls and Cows
You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

For example:
Secret number:  "1807"
Friend's guess: "7810"

Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return "1A3B". 
Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:
Secret number:  "1123"
Friend's guess: "0111"

In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and your function should return "1A1B".

You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

297	Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. 
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.


Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

295	Find Median from Data Stream
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
Examples: 
[2,3,4] , the median is 3
[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:


void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.


For example:
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.


For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Examples:

pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.

289	Game of Life

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."


Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):



Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.



Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.

Follow up: 

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

287	Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.


Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

284	Peeking Iterator
Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3].
Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.
You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that should return false.

Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. 


Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.


You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.


According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."


For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.


Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

240	Search a 2D Matrix II
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:


Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.



For example,

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true.
Given target = 20, return false.==================================================

239	Sliding Window Maximum
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

237	Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.


Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
==================================================

236	Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.


According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).â€�

         /  \
         7   4


For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.==================================================

235	Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.


According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).â€�

         /  \
         3   5


For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.==================================================

233	Number of Digit One
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

For example: 
Given n = 13,

==================================================

232	Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.


peek() -- Get the front element.


empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.


Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.


push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.


pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.


top() -- Get the top element.


empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.


Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.

218	The Skyline Problem
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).










The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.

For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
Notes:

 The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].
 The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li. 
 The output list must be sorted by the x position. 
 There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]

211	Add and Search Word - Data structure design

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addWord(word)
bool search(word)


search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.

For example:
addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true

210	Course Schedule II

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

For example:
2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]
4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is[0,2,1,3].

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:
2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess. 
The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. 
Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; 
other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step. 

Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Example 1:
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).


The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
==================================================

90	Subsets II

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.


For example,
If nums = [1,2,2], a solution is:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
==================================================

89	Gray Code
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.==================================================

88	Merge Sorted Array
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.==================================================

87	Scramble String

Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.


Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":

    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t


To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.


For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t


We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".


Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".

    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a


We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".


Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.
==================================================

86	Partition List
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.


You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.


For example,
Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
return 1->2->2->4->3->5.
==================================================

85	Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

For example, given the following matrix:

1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Return 6.
==================================================

84	Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].



The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.


For example,
Given heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.
==================================================

83	Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.


For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.
==================================================

82	Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.


For example,
Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.
==================================================

81	Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
The array may contain duplicates.==================================================

80	Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

For example,
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],


Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
==================================================

79	Word Search

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.


The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.


For example,
Given board = 
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
==================================================

78	Subsets

Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.


For example,
If nums = [1,2,3], a solution is:

[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],

  []
]
==================================================

77	Combinations

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.


For example,

[
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4],
]
==================================================

76	Minimum Window Substring

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).


For example,
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"


Minimum window is "BANC".


Note:
If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".


If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
==================================================

75	Sort Colors

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.


Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.


Note:
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Follow up:
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

==================================================

74	Search a 2D Matrix
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:


Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.



For example,

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]

Given target = 3, return true.==================================================

73	Set Matrix Zeroes

Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.

click to show follow up.
Follow up:

Did you use extra space?
A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

==================================================

72	Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)


You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:


a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
==================================================

71	Simplify Path
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"

click to show corner cases.
Corner Cases:


Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
In this case, you should return "/".
Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".

==================================================

70	Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
==================================================

69	Sqrt(x)
Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x.==================================================

68	Text Justification

Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.


You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.


Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.


For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.


For example,
words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
L: 16.


Return the formatted lines as:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]



Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.

click to show corner cases.
Corner Cases:


A line other than the last line might contain only one word. What should you do in this case?
In this case, that line should be left-justified.

Some examples:
"0" => true
"   0.1  " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

58	Length of Last Word
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

For example, 
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.
==================================================

57	Insert Interval
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].


Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].


This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
==================================================

56	Merge Intervals
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

For example,

  ["bat"]
]
Note: All inputs will be in lower-case.==================================================

48	Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
Note:
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.


Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. 


Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.


For example:
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]


The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "*") → true
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2.
Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.



For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 
A solution set is:

2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221


1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.


Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.


A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
==================================================

35	Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Here are few examples.
[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
==================================================

34	Search for a Range
Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

For example,
Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
return [3, 4].
==================================================

33	Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.==================================================

32	Longest Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.


For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.


Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.
==================================================

31	Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.


If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).


The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.


Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
==================================================

30	Substring with Concatenation of All Words

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.


For example, given:
s: "barfoothefoobarman"

==================================================

27	Remove Element
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.==================================================

26	Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.


For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],


Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
==================================================

25	Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.


k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
Only constant memory is allowed.

For example,
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5


For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5


For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
==================================================

24	Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.


For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.


Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
==================================================

==================================================

19	Remove Nth Node From End of List
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.


Note:
Given n will always be valid.

9	Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
click to show spoilers.
Some hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
==================================================

8	String to Integer (atoi)
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: 
It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front. 

Update (2015-02-10):
The signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a const char * argument, please click the reload button  to reset your code definition.

spoilers alert... click to show requirements for atoi.
Requirements for atoi:
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.

==================================================

7	Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x =  123, return  321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

click to show spoilers.
Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
==================================================

6	ZigZag Conversion

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R


And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".
==================================================

5	Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
Example:
Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.


Example:
Input: "cbbd"

Output: "bb"

==================================================

4	Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0


Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

==================================================

3	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.==================================================

2	Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8==================================================

1	Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
